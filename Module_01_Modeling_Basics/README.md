# Module 01: Modeling Basics - LLM-Assisted Model-Driven Development

This module demonstrates a complete model-driven development workflow using Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform requirements through various modeling languages into working implementation.

## Workflow Overview

This example showcases an AI-assisted approach to model-driven development, progressing through the following stages:

```
requirements.txt → SysML → Alloy → Verification → Java Implementation
```

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Requirements Specification (`requirements.txt`)
**Input**: Natural language requirement
```
Requirement:
Program shall output to command line "Hello World"
```

### 2. SysML Generation (`HelloWorld.sysml`)
**Process**: LLM transforms natural language requirement into SysML v2 specification
- **Input**: `requirements.txt`
- **Tool**: Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Output**: Structured SysML model with:
  - Block definitions
  - Attribute specifications
  - Action declarations
  - System structure

### 3. Alloy Specification Generation (`HelloWorld.als`)
**Process**: LLM converts SysML model into formal Alloy specification
- **Input**: `HelloWorld.sysml`
- **Tool**: Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Output**: Formal specification including:
  - Signature definitions for system components
  - Relationship modeling
  - Constraint specifications
  - Verification predicates

### 4. Model Verification
**Process**: Validate the formal model using Alloy Analyzer
- **Input**: `HelloWorld.als`
- **Tool**: Alloy Analyzer
- **Purpose**: 
  - Verify model consistency
  - Check constraint satisfaction
  - Validate requirement traceability
  - Ensure logical correctness

### 5. Java Implementation (`HelloWorld.java`)
**Process**: LLM generates executable code from verified SysML model
- **Input**: `HelloWorld.sysml` (verified via Alloy)
- **Tool**: Large Language Model (LLM)
- **Output**: Working Java implementation that:
  - Satisfies original requirements
  - Maintains traceability to models
  - Includes documentation linking back to specifications

## Key Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Automated Model Transformation**
- LLMs handle complex transformations between modeling languages
- Reduces manual effort in model creation
- Maintains consistency across different specification formats

### 2. **Formal Verification Integration**
- Alloy provides mathematical verification of model correctness
- Catches logical errors before implementation
- Ensures requirement satisfaction

### 3. **Requirements Traceability**
- Clear path from original requirement to final implementation
- Each transformation maintains linkage to source
- Facilitates change impact analysis

### 4. **Quality Assurance**
- Formal verification step validates design before coding
- Systematic approach reduces implementation errors
- Model-driven approach ensures consistency

## Tools and Technologies

- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: AI-assisted model generation and transformation
- **SysML v2**: Systems Modeling Language for system specification
- **Alloy**: Formal specification language with built-in analysis
- **Alloy Analyzer**: Model verification and validation tool
- **Java**: Target implementation language

## Learning Outcomes

By following this workflow, students learn:

1. **AI-Assisted Modeling**: How to leverage LLMs for model creation and transformation
2. **Multi-Language Modeling**: Working with different specification languages (SysML, Alloy)
3. **Formal Verification**: Using mathematical methods to validate models
4. **Model-Driven Development**: Systematic progression from requirements to implementation
5. **Requirements Traceability**: Maintaining clear linkage throughout the development process

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start with Requirements**: Define clear, testable requirements in `requirements.txt`
2. **Generate SysML**: Use LLM to create structured system model
3. **Create Alloy Specification**: Transform SysML to formal specification via LLM
4. **Verify Model**: Run Alloy Analyzer to validate correctness
5. **Generate Implementation**: Use LLM to create code from verified model
6. **Validate Implementation**: Ensure code satisfies original requirements

This approach demonstrates how modern AI tools can accelerate and improve traditional model-driven development practices while maintaining rigor through formal verification.
